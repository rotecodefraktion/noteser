// PullClassification — the discriminated-union shape every pull emits, one
// entry per remote file (and per implied directory / vault-settings change /
// orphan local note). The applyNonConflicts layer (`syncApply.ts`) consumes
// this list and either mutates the store or opens a merge tab.
//
// This file used to be a 250-line type block inside the monolithic
// `githubSync.ts`. It lives on its own now so the kinds can be referenced and
// extended without touching the much-larger pull/push orchestration files.
//
// The kinds — six "note" outcomes (`unchanged`, `remoteCreated`,
// `remoteUpdated`, `remoteDeleted`, `conflict`, `conflictDeleted`) plus the
// auto-merge, attachment, folder and vault-settings extensions — are
// documented inline below. See `docs/sync.md` for the user-facing summary of
// the six core kinds.

// `adoptPath` (pull-dedupe-by-path): present only when this classification
// is the result of the fallback reconciliation that matched a remote file to
// an UNLINKED local note (gitPath null/empty, or a stale gitPath no longer in
// the remote tree). The adopted note had no gitPath pointing at this file, so
// apply must SET note.gitPath = adoptPath. For a normal gitPath-keyed match
// the field is absent and apply leaves gitPath untouched.
export type PullClassification =

  // a reconciled unlinked note that still needs its gitPath linked on apply.

  // Remote has a file with no matching local note yet — create one.
  // progressive-clone: on a FIRST clone we emit these WITHOUT fetching the body
  // (remoteContent '', tags [], body '') and set `shell: true`. The apply layer
  // then creates a SHELL note (content '', contentLoaded false) so the sidebar
  // populates instantly; the body streams in afterwards. `shell` is absent/false
  // for an incremental pull's remoteCreated, which carries the real body as today.

  // Local exists, remote changed since our last push, local has NOT changed
