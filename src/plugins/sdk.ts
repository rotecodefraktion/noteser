// `import { definePlugin } from '@noteser/plugin-sdk'` and publish
// without depending on noteser's repo.
//
// For now, plugins authored in this repo (the test plugin under
// `plugins/test-plugin/`) import from `@/plugins/sdk` instead. Same
// surface, same types — only the import specifier changes when we
// graduate.
